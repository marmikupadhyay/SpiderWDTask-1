- [x]Design an intro page using pure HTML and CSS.Make the page look attractive aith just CSS.The page must include the game title and the play button and also captions/instructions to play if necssary. On the start of the game,bubbles of random sizes should be generated.

-[x]The bubble must move randomly and bounce in oppositye directions when they hit the sides or any other bubble.They must disappear immediately when the player clicks the bubble.

-[x]As the time progresses, the speed of bubble generation must increase.

-[x]Optimise the code, to make the animations and movement of bubbles look smooth

## Advanced Task

- [x] Get more creative by making the bubbles change colours and sizes dynamically with animations for bubble bursting.

- [x] After Player crosses a certain score, start creating rock-bubbles which require five clicks to get destroyed. Use your creativity to diffrentiate between rock bubbles from ordinary ones.

- [x]\*Allow the player to use "Felix-Felicis"(Liquid Luck) which slows down the rate of generation of bubbles for 5 secs.(Could be used only twice throughtout the gameplay) and the ratea of bubble generation is left as your choice.

- [x]\*Place Gauntlets rarely on-screen on clicking which you make a snap and clear half of the screen at once(even if there are rock-bubbles). The occurence of Gauntlet can increase with time.
